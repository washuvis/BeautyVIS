# Mini VLAT Activity using REACT + Flask

This repository contains the following three major parts. Each directory has its own README on how to run the code.

## frontend
This directory contains the (React) frontend of our web application which will be used for user studies.

## backend
This directory contains the (Python Flask) backend of our our web application. Ultimately, the techniques we develope in preprocessing will be moved to this directory for deployment.
